## Marcos Talamini

Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning programming languages and how to do things properly.
I was working on a discord bot and a web page to build RPG sheet.

Next.js, Prisma, Python, Docker and so on.

I'm from Brazil and i trying to do my best.

My e-mail and discord is below, if you want to contact me.
